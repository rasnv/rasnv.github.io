    <p> I am a physics graduate and have a strong passion for studying planetary formation and surface processes by combining numerical modeling with data analysis, utilizing both remote sensing and in-situ data. 
    Currently, I am working on numerical simulations using shock physics hydrocode to study the formation of impact craters and processes in lunar south polar regions.</p>
